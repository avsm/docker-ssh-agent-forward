Forward SSH agent socket into a container

Still experimental -- contact anil@recoil.org or bryan@uber.com if you want help.


## Installation

Assuming you have a `/usr/local`

```
$ git clone git://github.com/uber-common/docker-ssh-agent-forward
$ cd docker-ssh-agent-forward
$ make
$ make install
```

On every boot, do:

```
pinata-ssh-forward
```

and the you can run `pinata-ssh-mount` to get a Docker CLI fragment that adds
the SSH agent socket and sets `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` within the container.

```
$ pinata-ssh-mount
-v ssh-agent:/ssh-agent -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent/ssh-agent.sock

$ docker run -it $(pinata-ssh-mount) 
/ssh-agent-forward ssh -T git@github.com

Hi avsm! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

To fetch the latest image, do:

```
pinata-ssh-pull
```

## Troubleshooting

If pinata-ssh-forward fails to run, run `ssh-add -l`. If there are no identities, then run `ssh-add`.

## Developing

To build an image yourself rather than fetching from Docker Hub, run
`./pinata-ssh-build.sh` from your clone of this repo.

We didn't bother installing the build script with the Makefile since using the
hub image should be the common case.
