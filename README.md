Forward SSH agent socket into a container

Still experimental -- contact anil@recoil.org if you want help.

## Installation

Assuming you'd like to install to /usr/local

```
$ git clone git://github.com/avsm/docker-ssh-agent-forward
$ make
$ PREFIX=/usr/local make install
```

## Usage

On every boot, do:

```
$ pinata-ssh-forward
```

If you install in current folder.
```
$ make
$ PREFIX=. make install

$ bin/pinata-ssh-forward
`

and then you can run `pinata-ssh-mount` to get a Docker CLI fragment
that adds the SSH agent socket and set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` within the container.

```
$ pinata-ssh-mount 
-v /Users/avsm/.pinata-sshd/ssh-1azk9Mmd27/agent.16:/tmp/ssh-agent.sock --env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agent.sock

$ docker run -it `pinata-ssh-mount` ocaml/opam ssh git@github.com
